            <p id="about-prg">Deadpool, also known as Wade Wilson, first appeared in <br>*New Mutants #98* in 1990 as a
                mercenary with
                a darkly <br> humorous personality. After undergoing an experimental <br> procedure to cure his cancer,
                he gained a
                regenerative <br> healing factor but was left disfigured. Currently, Deadpool <br> continues his chaotic
                adventures as an anti-hero, often <br> breaking the fourth wall and engaging in outrageous antics.

                    firearms, using them to great effect. His Desert Eagles are current-production Mark XIX models with
                    over-barrel Picatinny-style rails made by IWI in Israel. They are recognizable by their safeties,
                    which are retained from the original production Mark XIX; the U.S.-made Magnum Research version, in
                    contrast, now has the "teardrop"-style safety found on the original Mark I.</div>
